#BMStart - List all your bookmarks as new tab page

BMStart is a Google Chrome extension.  
It does only one thing: override your new tab page with most-visited and all your bookmarks(all javascript bookmarklets exclude).

##About the idea
[Spartak](http://v2ex.com/member/spartak), a member of [ve2x.com](http://ve2x.com) first [asked](http://v2ex.com/t/32528#reply7) if there had such an extension. So I made this. Thank you!

##About licence
Because I do not want to know the differences between so many Licences, so I decided to use no one.  
Anyone can **copy**, **redistribute**, **modify**, **reuse** the source code, without reserve any information about this project.
